# NYT-Bestsellers-CatKey-Generator
This project is designed for libraries using the Solus Library App and the SirsiDynix Symphony ILS. It automates the process of collecting ISBNs from the New York Times Bestseller lists, locating their corresponding CatKeys in the library catalog, and emailing a grouped report of those CatKeys. Useful for book rivers within the app.
